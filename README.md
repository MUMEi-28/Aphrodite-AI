# Aphrodite AI 💖

Aphrodite AI is a fun and interactive AI-powered love assistant that brings romance, entertainment, and fortune-telling into one engaging platform. Whether you want to chat with Aphrodite, play a romantic-themed Hangman game (not really...), or discover your love fortune, this project has something for you!

## 🌟 Features

- 💬 **ChatBot** – Talk with Aphrodite AI, your virtual romantic assistant powered by Hugging Face’s Mistral model.
- 🎮 **Hangman: Love Edition** – A fun word-guessing game with a romantic twist.
- 🔮 **Love Fortune Teller** – Get AI-generated romantic fortunes to guide your love life.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React JS** – For building the front-end interface.
- **Vite** – For fast development and build optimization.
- **Tailwind CSS** – For modern and responsive styling.
- **Hugging Face API (Mistral Model)** – For generating chatbot responses.
- **BoxIcons** – For various UI icons.
- **GPT** – Used to generate random messages and icons.

## 🚨 API Limitation

If Aphrodite responds with:

> *"I'm sorry, I couldn't generate a response."*

This means you've reached the Hugging Face API's rate limit. Ain't no way am paying for APIs
